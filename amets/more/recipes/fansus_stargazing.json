	startdescription: "The Stargazing Society had risen to power in the First and Second Histories, but as it rose it soon schismed or disbanded. In the Second History, their leader flew away into the Mansus after discovering 'the bird's feather-dress', learning the secrets of flight and travel.",
	description: "In the First History, Edward Pierce, one of the more eccentric members of the Society, began espousing the worship of the Elder Sister, the fairylike Hour who takes anything she fancies. Only one Stargazing Society remains to this day. [Enjoy your tantras! The first few are in english, because it seemed silly to lock basic lore behind Sanskrit & the Stargazing Society had its share of translators.]",

Caille’s translation intersperses them with potent comparisons of the Tower’s murals to constellation of stars discovered during his own expedition to the Cape of Good Hope.",

    warmup:60,
    startdescription: "The translation is simple, if not spartan, but the prologue, written in a different style from Fletcher’s own, suggests that a more flowery translation would improperly contextualize the meaning of the Tantra.",
    description: "‘A garden of silver trees, heavy with golden peaches, grows around the Tower. The taste of those peaches is the Second Treasure. To access it is to transgress, but no punishment awaits those who had freed themselves.’",

    description: "‘The Fourth Treasure, known also as the Patient Treasure, comes to those who know their every passion like the palm of their hand. Bodhisattva Samantabhadra crushed all but one temptation in his hand, and holds onto the world by his last compassionate wish.’",

The Tantra feels no need to explain the concepts it introduces - concepts that have not been properly expressed in any human language - and immediately begins with an exploration of the interplay between Eyes, Forms and the Self.",
    description: "‘The Fifth Treasure is the ability to close all five of one’s eyes, and look upon the formless realm. The formless realm is not within you, as it is not without you, as you do not exist.’",
